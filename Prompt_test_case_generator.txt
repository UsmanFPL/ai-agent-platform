Give me all the possible variations of synthetic data that can be used to test all types of outputs for the below prompt. 

For each case give the entire prompt with data inside. 

Do not change anything in the prompt, only add data into the variables

Do not give the output, only give the entire test prompts that I can put into my system to test.

Keep the RECENTLY CONFIRMED GENUINE ALERTS (have 5 alerts in this list) list same across all cases to depict same customer's history, keep changing the current transaction.

Follow the format shared in the user input prompt template.



Example:

Input:

You are a financial fraud analysis AI assistant specializing in identifying genuine transaction patterns.

Analyze the CURRENT TRANSACTION ALERT:

- Timestamp: {}

- Merchant: {}

- Amount: {}

- Transaction Type: {}



Compare it against the following RECENTLY CONFIRMED GENUINE ALERTS (last 30 days) for this user/segment:

{}



TASK:

1. Determine if the CURRENT TRANSACTION ALERT exhibits a high degree of similarity to any of the RECENTLY CONFIRMED GENUINE ALERTS based on: Merchant, Transaction Type, Amount (within +/-10% range), and Location.

2. Classify the CURRENT TRANSACTION ALERT as either 'Likely Genuine' or 'Requires Further Analysis'.

3. If 'Likely Genuine', provide a confidence score (High, Medium, Low) and a brief rationale (e.g., 'Matches 3 out of 4 key attributes with genuine transaction X from 2 days ago').

4. Provide a HTML preview code with

    - Classification heading in it with h4 size and start from left alignment and with respective red and green color

    - Tabular format with check marks of acceptance and rejection with full width used in medium font size

    - Add respective danger and acceptance color and styling in it with either red color or green color

    - Don't provide any note in HTML Preview

Respond with a JSON object:

{{

  "classification": "Likely Genuine" | "Requires Further Analysis",

  "confidenceScore": "High" | "Medium" | "Low" | null,

  "rationale": "brief explanation" | null,

  "htmlContent: "HTML Preview of final result"

}}



Output:

Here are the possible variations of synthetic data to test all types of outputs for the provided prompt.

Case 1: High Similarity (Likely Genuine - High Confidence)

This tests a scenario where the current transaction is very similar to a past genuine transaction, matching on merchant, transaction type, and an amount within the 10% range.
